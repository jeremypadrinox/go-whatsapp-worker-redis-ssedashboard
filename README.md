## Overview

Go-WhatsApp Worker is the orchestration brain that sits behind your WhatsApp automation stack. It ingests API requests, splits and queues bulk campaigns, simulates human behaviour, persists history to PostgreSQL, and calls the official worker (`go-whatsapp-web-multidevice`) one message at a time. Everything ships with an immersive web dashboard, SSE-based live statistics, and a health monitor that keeps the system self-healing.

> ⚠️ This project does **not** send WhatsApp messages by itself. Bring your own running instance of [`go-whatsapp-web-multidevice`](https://github.com/aldinokemal/go-whatsapp-web-multidevice); we take care of everything before the final send call.

## Highlights

- **Smart Endpoint Rotation**: Circuit breaker pattern with automatic failure detection and recovery for multiple WhatsApp endpoints.
- Human-paced engine with typing simulation, rate profiles, natural breaks, and exponential backoff.
- Redis Streams consumer groups with delayed retries, idle message reclaiming, and horizontal fan-out.
- Chunked campaign coordinator that safely handles tens of thousands of recipients per request.
- Real-time operational dashboard with Message Playground, queue analytics, and SSE metrics.
- Direct PostgreSQL integration for message history, campaign progress, and audit trails.
- File lifecycle manager: streaming uploads to `tmp/`, UUID naming, secure cleanup, and hourly purges.
- Health monitor loop for stuck messages, Redis connectivity, and worker statistics.
- Docker-first deployment with a single command, yet equally friendly for local Go development.

## Message Lifecycle

1. **Ingress** – An authenticated request hits `/api/send/...`. Uploads stream directly into `tmp/` using constant memory.
2. **Campaign planning** – Bulk requests are split into `BULK_CHUNK_SIZE` slices. Campaign + chunk records persist in PostgreSQL with UUID tokens.
3. **Queueing** – Each message becomes a JSON payload in Redis Streams (`XADD`) plus metadata in the database.
4. **Processing** – Worker goroutines use `XREADGROUP` to claim work, simulate typing, and route through the smart load balancer.
5. **Smart Routing** – Circuit breaker pattern automatically selects healthy endpoints, excludes failed ones, and handles automatic recovery.
6. **Retry & delay** – Failures increment attempts, schedule exponential backoff (via sorted set), or mark the message as permanently failed.
7. **Cleanup** – Successful (or definitively failed) media triggers immediate file deletion along with hourly sweeps.
8. **Metrics** – Statistics stream to `/api/statistics/stream` and the dashboard updates live with circuit breaker status.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go `1.23+`
- Redis `>= 5` with Streams support
- PostgreSQL `13+`
- Running instance of [`go-whatsapp-web-multidevice`](https://github.com/aldinokemal/go-whatsapp-web-multidevice)
- WhatsApp session authenticated within the sender project

### 1. Clone & configure

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gowhatsapp-worker.git
cd gowhatsapp-worker
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Redis, PostgreSQL, and WhatsApp credentials
```

### 2. Option A – Docker Compose (recommended for first run)

```powershell
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

- API & dashboard: `http://localhost:8081`
- Worker + health monitor run in the same container

### 3. Option B – Local Go environment

```powershell
go mod download
go run main.go start
```

The `start` command spins up the API, Redis consumer, delayed retry scheduler, and health monitor in a single process.

### 4. Dedicated worker mode (scale horizontally)

```powershell
go run main.go redis-worker
```

Use this mode to add more queue consumers while keeping a single API instance.

## Configuration

### Essential environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_HOST` | ✅ | – | PostgreSQL hostname for direct connection |
| `DATABASE_USER` / `DATABASE_PASSWORD` | ✅ | – | Database credentials |
| `WHATSAPP_BASE_URL` | ✅ | – | Base URL of `go-whatsapp-web-multidevice` |
| `WHATSAPP_AUTH` | ✅ | – | API token for the sender |
| `WHATSAPP_ENDPOINTS` | – | – | Comma-separated URLs for multi-endpoint load balancing |
| `WHATSAPP_AUTHS` | – | – | Comma-separated auth tokens for multi-endpoint setup |
| `REDIS_HOST` | ✅ | `localhost` | Redis Streams host |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_NAME` | – | `pending_messages` | Stream key for enqueued messages |
| `DASHBOARD_USERNAME` / `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | ✅ (if auth enabled) | `admin` / `admin` | Basic Auth credentials |
| `RATE_PROFILE` | – | `manual` | Switch between manual and bulk pacing strategies |
| `BULK_CHUNK_SIZE` | – | `500` | Recipients per chunk when splitting bulk requests |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED` | – | `true` | Enable/disable circuit breaker pattern |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | – | `3` | Failures before opening circuit |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD` | – | `2` | Successes to close circuit |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPEN_TIMEOUT` | – | `2m` | Cooldown before retry |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_HALF_OPEN_TIMEOUT` | – | `30s` | Testing period duration |

See `.env.example` or `internal/config/config.go` for the complete catalogue (Redis timeouts, natural breaks, SSE toggles, etc.).

### Rate profiles at a glance

| Profile | When to use | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `manual` | One-off or low volume | Uses `RATE_LIMIT_DELAY_MIN/MAX`, typing delays, natural breaks |
| `bulk` | Campaigns > 1k recipients | Respects `RATE_DELAY_MEAN_MS`, `RATE_DELAY_JITTER_MS`, burst cooldowns, configurable concurrency |

Changing the profile at runtime does not require restarting; the worker will adapt on the next loop.

## API Surface

All endpoints are protected by Basic Auth when `ENABLE_AUTH=true`.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/` | Dashboard + Message Playground |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check endpoint (unprotected) |
| `POST` | `/api/send/message` | Queue a text message (bulk supported via comma-separated or JSON array) |
| `POST` | `/api/send/image` | Queue an image (file upload or remote URL) |
| `POST` | `/api/send/file` | Queue any attachment |
| `GET` | `/api/statistics/stream` | Server-Sent Events stream with live KPIs |
| `GET` | `/api/endpoints/stats` | Endpoint statistics with circuit breaker status |
| `GET` | `/docs` | Interactive documentation portal |
| `GET` | `/docs/openapi.yml` | Machine-readable OpenAPI spec |

Full request/response examples live in `docs/endpoint.md` and the dashboard’s Playground mirrors the same contracts.

## Dashboard & Observability

<p align="center">
  <img src="./public/3.png" alt="Go-WhatsApp Worker dashboard, message playground and live metrics" width="760">
</p>

- Message Playground for text, image, and file flows with bulk support.
- Live queue depth, throughput, retry and failure counters via SSE.
- Embedded API docs, configuration hints, and quick links to metrics.

## Smart Endpoint Rotation

The system now includes intelligent endpoint management with circuit breaker pattern for maximum reliability:

### Circuit Breaker States
- **CLOSED (Healthy)**: Endpoint accepts messages normally
- **OPEN (Failed)**: Endpoint excluded from rotation for cooldown period  
- **HALF_OPEN (Testing)**: Endpoint being tested for recovery

### Automatic Failure Detection
- **Critical Failures**: HTTP 401/403 (user logout) trigger immediate circuit opening
- **Threshold Failures**: 3 consecutive failures open the circuit
- **Smart Recovery**: Gradual testing with 2 successful messages required to close circuit

### Configuration
```bash
# Circuit Breaker Settings
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED=true
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=3     # Failures before opening
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD=2     # Successes to close
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPEN_TIMEOUT=2m         # Cooldown before retry
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_HALF_OPEN_TIMEOUT=30s   # Testing period

# Multi-Endpoint Configuration
WHATSAPP_ENDPOINTS=https://wa1.example.com,https://wa2.example.com,https://wa3.example.com
WHATSAPP_AUTHS=auth_token_1,auth_token_2,auth_token_3
```

### Benefits
- **Zero Wasted Retries**: No attempts on known-bad endpoints
- **Maintained Throughput**: Automatic failover to healthy endpoints
- **WhatsApp Account Safety**: Respectful retry intervals and backoff
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Dashboard shows circuit breaker states

## Bulk Campaign Engine

<p align="center">
  <img src="./public/4.png" alt="Bulk architecture diagram" width="760">
</p>

- `BULK_CHUNK_SIZE` recipients per chunk to avoid oversized payloads.
- Campaign tokens allow pausing/resuming or resubmitting only failed chunks.
- Database records track per-chunk attempts, backoff timers, and error trails.
- Works equally for media/file campaigns; uploads are re-used per chunk.

## Queue, Rate Limiting & Health

- Redis Streams consumer group (`workers`) with individual `REDIS_CONSUMER_NAME` per instance.
- Idle (stuck) messages are reclaimed via `XCLAIM` if they exceed `STUCK_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT`.
- Exponential backoff up to 5 minutes per retry, capped by `WORKER_MAX_RETRIES`.
- Health monitor cron checks database, Redis, queue lag, worker stats, and circuit breaker states.
- Natural typing presence toggles emulate human behaviour before each send request.
- Circuit breaker monitoring with automatic alerting for endpoint failures and recovery.

## File Handling Guarantees

- Every upload is streamed to `tmp/` with UUID filenames and extension whitelisting.
- Files are deleted on success, on terminal failure, and again by the hourly janitor.
- Detailed structured logs trace file lifecycle for auditing.
- Configurable storage root via `utils.NewFileStorage("tmp")` if you need shared volumes.

## Development & Testing

```powershell
# Run unit and integration tests
go test ./...

# Start the full stack (API + worker + health monitor)
go run main.go start

# Launch only the worker (for horizontal scaling)
go run main.go redis-worker --health-check=false
```

The repository ships with `.air.toml` for hot reloading if you prefer iterative development with [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air).

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot connect to Redis** – verify version ≥ 5.0 and credentials; Streams require `XADD` support.
- **Messages stuck in processing** – check health logs; the reclaim loop runs every `STUCK_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT`.
- **Media not delivered** – ensure `go-whatsapp-web-multidevice` instance accepts file endpoints and file type.
- **High failure rate** – check dashboard statistics and consider increasing backoff.
- **Dashboard auth fails** – change credentials via `DASHBOARD_USERNAME`/`PASSWORD` and restart.
- **All endpoints failing** – check circuit breaker states in dashboard; verify WhatsApp session authentication.
- **Circuit breaker not opening** – ensure `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED=true` and check failure thresholds.
- **Endpoint recovery issues** – verify `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD` and timeout settings.
